# Crosslinks Enhancements

Adds options to limit cross links detection by drawn items color and to cross links inside a polygon

This is a plugin for [Ingress Intel Total Conversion (IITC)](https://github.com/iitc-project/ingress-intel-total-conversion/).

## Overview

This plugin allows to:
- choose drawn items colors to be included or excluded from cross links detection;
- choose a polygon to limit cross links detection to links contained or intersecting it


## Installation
[Click here](https://github.com/manierim/crosslinks-enhancements/raw/master/crosslinks-enhancements.user.js) and your userscript manager should do it.

## Requirements

- [cross links](https://iitc.me/desktop/): Checks for existing links that cross planned links. Requires draw-tools plugin
- [draw tools](https://iitc.me/desktop/): Allow drawing things onto the current map so you may plan your next move

## Usage

@todo

## Compatibility

The plugin has been tested with the following versions (current at the time of writing):
- cross links version 1.1.2.20181031.195523
- draw tools version 0.7.0.20181031.195523

Modifications of both plugins might work as long as they do not change the original plugin behavior too much.
